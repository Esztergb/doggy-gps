## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
- What is the purpose of your project?
- Why did you undertake it?

Users will be presented with a homepage to click on in order to start searching for dog breeds they are interested in.  Once on the search page, the user will be able to search any dog breed, and a list of attributes will be displayed for that particular dog: barking, energy, shedding, trainability which are all rated on a scale of 1-5.  As soon as the user inputs a breed to search, it will immediately reveal in the search input below to find available dogs of that breed to adopt.

This app was created for anyone looking for a furry friend in their life.  It was created to make their lives a bit easier by being able to search for the type of dog and available dogs to adopt in one search engine.  Team Pewter City decided to undertake this project because we are all dog lovers.
